Recommender Systems for Jokes!
Final Project for CSCI 4022: Advanced Data Science for Fall 2019 semester at University of Colorado, Boulder.
Project by Adam Ten Hoeve

For this project, I created multiple recommender systems based on rankings from jokes. Both the jokes and the rankings were provided by Univsersity of California, Berkeley and can be found at: http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/.

The constructed recommender systems were from methods including:
* A collaborative method (peer-to-peer)
* A content based method from self-assigned tags per joke
* A content based method from TF-IDF data from the jokes
* A content based method using a hybrid of the tags and TF-IDF methods
* A hybrid method that used a combination of the collaboritive and content based methods.

Please see attatched document for additional information on my process, methods and execution.
